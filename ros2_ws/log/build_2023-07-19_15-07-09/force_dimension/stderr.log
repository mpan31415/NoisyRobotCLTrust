[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindForceDimensionSDK.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ForceDimensionSDK", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ForceDimensionSDK"
  with any of the following names:

    ForceDimensionSDKConfig.cmake
    forcedimensionsdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ForceDimensionSDK" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ForceDimensionSDK_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ForceDimensionSDK" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
